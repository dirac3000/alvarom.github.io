My name is Alvaro Moran and I am a 38 years old electronics engineer. I was born in Venezuela, grew up in Italy, traveled many countries ad finally living in Toulouse, France.
I am interested in technology, especially Linux, open source software and embedded systems.

I work asÂ embedded software engineer at [Brainchip](http://www.brainchip.com). You can take a look at my [curriculum](http://alvarom.com/curriculum/).

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I also love photography, I have have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jenik/" target="_blank">flickr stream</a> and some stuff on <a href="http://instagram.com/dirac3000" target="_blank">instagram</a> too.<br /> I really like walking, cycling (when it&#8217;s not too cold), travelling and meeting new people to talk with.</span>
