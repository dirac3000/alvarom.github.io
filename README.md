# alvarom.github.io

This is the code for alvarom.com.
I used to put my content on a hosted wordpress, but now I moved it to github pages and jekyll, because it's much more convenient.
To do that I followed the [girliemac's guide](https://girliemac.com/blog/2013/12/27/wordpress-to-jekyll/) on the subject.

Feel free to use it if needed!
